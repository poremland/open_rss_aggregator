# Test, Test, Test...
> Originally this was a project designed to help me learn Ruby and Rails back in 2008. At the time I hadn't quite grasped the concept of properly unit testing Rails apps. And frankly since then I've been lazy and this app hasn't changed much other than to upgrade it to Rails 3.
> This project could use some unit test love.

# UI
> The primary purpose of this app is to expose a RESTFul API that can be hit from a 3rd party client. But it's also got a Single Page App UI design that allows it to be consumed via the web as well.
> There are a TON of things that need to be updated in the UI.

* Feed Cards
	* Make the cards touch friendly
* Reactive Design
* Custom themes
* Add a UI for the `Favorites` functionality exposed by the API
* Add the ability to allow multiple email domains for authentication
